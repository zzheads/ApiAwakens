    //      food stock as the MacD [s]bread and butter[/s] Burger.
    //      In the US the Big-Mac on average sell for 4.2 dollars in 2012. (8)
    //      the price of a Big Mac was 6.7 GCS in the Galaxy (At Dex's Diner)
    //      the price of a Big Mac was 4.2 USD in the United States (Varies by Store)
    //      the implied purchasing power parity was 1.6 GCS to 1 USD , that is 6.7/4.2 = 1.59
    //      In the Euro-zone the Big-Mac price varies, but on average sell for 4.43 USD.
